<h2>Wildfires</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Stop the spread of wildfire using an arsenal of gear and your strategic mind in order to save the grasslands from turning into a fiery inferno.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
To feel challenged by the puzzle aspects of the game.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
Puzzle/Strategy
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
The player is a firefighter who uses various tools in order to douse fires. Fires spread in random pattern along every X number of frames; the less damaged caused by the fires to the grassland, your higher the score. If the entire grassland is aflame, the game ends. You start off with a basic bucket and a well for water, giving you the option to douse a fire directly with the majority of your bucket, or to dampen the grounds around a series of fires in order to slow its spread. As you progress, you’ll get your hands on better and crazier gear such as the water hose, the sprinkler system, the fire hose, and the fire extinguisher. Fires will spread faster and faster as you go on; can you get the gear to douse the flames in time?
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
Demonstrate working fire spread. Lacked time to implement tools to stop spread of fire.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
-Features a fast-paced puzzle mechanism behind the gameplay providing a healthy mix of tension and tactics to the player. 
-Theme of the game is novel; playing as a firefighter isn't common
-Very comic in nature, with the premise and tools to fight the fires being stylized in an over-the-top manner
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
The game takes place in a temperate flatland featuring tall grasses and occasional trees and shrubbery. There’s a small town nearby which is where the player, as a fireman/woman, is based out of. Being a small town, the game takes place primarily in nature as the firefighter attempts to put out the fires. The firefighter is the sole character; resigned, determined, and poorly funded, he’s the first and last line of defense the town has against the oncoming fire.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
The player takes the role of a firefighter based out of the region in a small station that’s been suffering from severe budget cuts; as a result, their only functioning equipment is a small bucket and access to an old well. Calamity strikes when lighting strikes, starting a fire that quickly begins to spread towards the small town nearby. Being the only fireman/unlucky fool for miles, it’s now your job to stop the fire, or at the very least slow it down enough that the residents can escape. The fireman knowingly accepts his fate, off to be heroic with a small grumble about the unfairness of life. Donning his uniform and with bucket in hand, he marches off to the well; they’re the baddest firefighter for miles around and it’s time to show it.
